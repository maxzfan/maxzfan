I'm 18, studying **Computer Science (AI)** and **Math** at **Stanford**. Right now I'm building a startup in architecture, and working as Founding Engineer at **Friday (YC F24)**. On campus, I'm an ASES Bootcamper and serve as the Financial Officer for the Class of 2029.

### Research & Engineering

I'm interested in computational linguistics, genomics, quantum computing, and world models, among other things. I've built deep research agents at **Sylvan Labs**, developed NLP constraint parsers at **Fastbreak AI**, researched phonetic alignment of Bantu languages at **Harvard** and **MIT**, and created ML models predicting cancer likelihood from 3D genome structure at **UCLA**. Most recently, I presented a research project on quantum interferometry at Stanford, an ML model trained on simulated 3d worlds that can detect underground caves and tunnels with only surface measurements. 

### Arts and Hobbies

When I'm not building, I'm at the piano. I performed **Chopin's Concerto No. 1** as a soloist with the **Boston Pops** at Symphony Hall, was a **2024 YoungArts Winner** in Classical Piano, and completed performance studies at **Mozarteum Salzburg**. In my free time, I'm trading stocks, reading science fiction, and playing tennis.

### Fun Facts

- I speak English, Chinese, Spanish, German, and Italian, plus Latin and Ancient Greek for the classics. I'm always dabbling in more, learning Hindi and Arabic currently!
- I attended Ad Astra School in SpaceX HQ, founded by Elon Musk, throughout middle school.
- I'm ambidextrous: I write (and eat) with both hands, and even hit two forehadns in tennis.
- My favorite number is 176 (coincidentally my IQ score!)
