</p>

I'm studying **Computer Science (AI)** and **Mathematics** at **Stanford**. Right now I'm building a stealth startup as Co-Founder & CTO, while also serving as a Founding Engineer at **Friday (YC F24)**. On campus, I'm the Financial Officer for the Class of '29 and was selected for **Stanford ASES** (Top 3 at Demo Day).

### 🧬 Research & Engineering

My work spans AI, genomics, and linguistics. I've built deep research agents at **Sylvan Labs**, developed NLP constraint parsers at **Fastbreak AI**, created ML models predicting cancer likelihood from 3D genome structure at **UCLA**, and researched phonetic alignment of Bantu languages at **Harvard** and **MIT**.

### 🎹 The Arts

When I'm not coding, I'm at the piano. I performed **Chopin's Concerto No. 1** as a soloist with the **Boston Pops** at Symphony Hall, was a **2024 YoungArts Winner** in Classical Piano, and completed performance studies at **Mozarteum Salzburg**.

### 🌍 Languages

I speak English, Chinese, German, Spanish, and Italian, read Latin and Ancient Greek, and code primarily in Python with AI/ML stacks.
